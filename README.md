# Robot Vacuum Cleaner

Suppose you have a robot vacuum cleaner. After placing it on the floor, could it sweep the entire floor without map information? In other words, just by bumping the wall, could the robot accomplish the task?

Here is the simulation video: [Robot Vacuum Cleaner Simulation](https://youtu.be/AFBVZCKAXzI)

## How to run: (MacOS)
g++ -std=c++11 Cleaner.cpp

./a.out ./map/map.txt

If you want to see a simple animation,

./a.out ./map/map.txt 1

I haven't tested in Linux and Windows, but I guess the code will work fine under Linux.
